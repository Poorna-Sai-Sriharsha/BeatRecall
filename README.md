## 🥁 BeatRecall
BeatRecall is an interactive web-based rhythm memory game where players test their memory by following sequences of drum sounds. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a modern, responsive UI with smooth animations, engaging audio, and intuitive controls. Players can interact via mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, or hover effects to preview sounds, making it accessible and fun on both desktop and mobile devices.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Play drum sounds (kick, snare, hi-hat, tom, clap, cowbell) via clicks or keyboard inputs (K, S, H, T, P, B).
- 📋 Follow increasingly complex sequences to test your rhythm memory.

- 🎨 Modern UI with gradient backgrounds, subtle animations, and responsive design.
- 🔊 Audio feedback with hover previews for an immersive experience.

## 🧠 How It Works
- BeatRecall generates a random sequence of drum sounds based on the current round.
- Players watch and listen as the sequence is played with visual highlights on drum buttons.
- Replicate the sequence by clicking buttons or pressing corresponding keys (K, S, H, T, P, B).
- Correct inputs advance the game with a new, longer sequence; mistakes reset the game.
- Visual and audio cues, along with error handling, ensure a smooth user experience.
